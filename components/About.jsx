                <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'> I specialize in building JavaScript applications and like to work on all parts of the tech stack. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
                In my free time I like to travel, train mixed martial arts, and work on personal projects.  </p>
