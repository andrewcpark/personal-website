    As my first year of coding approaches, I decided to take some time and reflect on the progress I made thus far. Although I feel like I barely scratched the surface, I’m often surprised by how much I’m able to understand coding conversations on Youtube or even with some of my developer friends. I’m proud of the steps taken and excited for the journey ahead.

    My first steps into coding were very intimidating. I came from a non-STEM background and having worked in Real Estate for the past couple of years, my job required a much different set of skills. So when I opened a coding lesson for the first time, it was a completely new situation for me, going from reading housing contracts to coding variables and functions. My friends would throw out terms like React, Node, and JavaScript, which meant nothing to me at the time, would soon become my sole attention and focus for the next months to come. But I was determined to make it work and everyday, I slowly learned a little more.

    The first programming language I learned was JavaScript. Without having much context, it was widely recommended to start there and was the required language for many of the bootcamps I was looking into. It took some time getting used to the syntax and functions but it ended up opening many doors to new technologies. The different libraries, frameworks, and developer tools, just for this one language made me realize how vast this industry is. And I’m here just getting started.

    I decided to partake in a coding bootcamp called Codesmith in order to further my skills. I had several friends who graduated from the program so this was the one I applied for. Codesmith requires a technical interview to be admitted and led me to spend weeks studying to get in. Upon acceptance, it was three months of hardcore coding for six days a week. Here I was exposed to various technologies and like minded engineers also getting started in their coding journey. What I really enjoyed about Codesmith were the other students, learning with and from each other. Some of them have become great friends and we occasionally meet up for dinners.

    Working on projects was where everything came together. Throughout the weeks of exercises and practice, I got to bring my ideas to life. I will never forget when I first logged “hello world” and the first time I spun up my web application. Making my app appear on the screen through HTML and CSS was one thing but what really excited me was giving the buttons functionalities. It was like it came to life. Even if it was a simple task to change the text color from red to blue, or make a box disappear. The process gave me a glimpse of what it took to be a software engineer. Whether working by myself or with a team, I got a taste of what my day to day might look like in the field. I learned while you might spend time coding alone, there were many elements that involved collaboration and teamwork.

    As I continue to dive into the world of programming and work on my craft, I have always held on to becoming a T-Shaped person in whatever I do. Simply put, having a wide basic knowledge of the foundations (the top of the “T”) but specializing in a particular discipline (the stem of the “T”). In my next post, I will go more in depth of this concept in the context of software engineering.
