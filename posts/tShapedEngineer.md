 <p> Striving to become this “T-Shaped” person was first introduced to me during a marketing class back in college. Essentially you were someone of a skillset to have broad knowledge (the top horizontal bar of the “T”) but also specialize deeply in one of those subjects (the vertical stem of the “T”). So a social media marketer may hold general knowledge across all of marketing but is also a social media specialist. Although this concept was taught to me in the context of marketing, I held onto this ideology wherever I went. 
</p>
<br>
<p> Naturally, as I dug deeper into software engineering, becoming a T-Shaped software engineer kept tugging at me. Where I stand currently, I’m still working on top of the “T”. While I’ve been exposed across the tech stack, I would like to first, solidify myself as a full stack engineer. And during my way there, I know I’ll end up leaning towards a certain direction.
</p>
<br>
<p>Now if I had to choose today and go down a specific path to specialize, I would choose frontend engineering. Throughout my career, I have always been interested in client or customer facing work. This translated into my interest in building front facing interfaces and experiences. I’m looking forward to contributing towards products and features that will ultimately interact with the end user. 
</p>
<br>
<p>As I find my way through this industry, I will always be mindful of how I can become a T-shaped engineer. I’ll look back at this post years from now and see if things have changed or if I was correct about my path. Either way, I’ll enjoy the journey and the fact that there’ll always be new technology to learn and specialize. Maybe I’ll hunker down on React or become strictly an iOS developer? Whatever I may end up choosing, I hope this post encourages you to reflect and see where you’re at in your own “T” journey.
