## Description

This website was created using Next.js, React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. I leveraged Next.js' page routing for it's ease of use and and quick development. Components were made using React and used React hooks to handle component state changes. Tailwind allowed me to style components quickly by directly styling the elements. Currently, the website is deployed on Vercel.
